Brief teaser for recruiters

Hi there! I see you've found your way to my online portfolion. This is likely if I've submit my CV to your company. Thanks for making it here, and I hope you enjoy your stay.
The folders in this github correspond to listed projects on the cv!

Start with Image_Partitioning, it is older, but more meaningful for me (will tell you more about me). Note I am not making the code public now, but I'll show it if requested.

Then, if you wish, more to lira_prediction, it is a more recent group project, and many codes are included.

My other projects (RPS contests, sila.ai work..) are either contests in process, or held under an NDA, so I must refrain from sharing here.

Best
