Brief teaser for recruiters

Hi there! I see you've found your way to my online portfolio. This likely means I've submit my CV to your company. Thanks for making it here! 
The folders in this github correspond to listed projects on the cv.

Start with Image_Partitioning, it is older, but is dear to me, and tells you more about me than the second project. Note I am not making the code public now, but I'll show it if requested.

Then, if you wish, more to lira_prediction, it is a more recent group project, and many codes are included.

My other projects (RPS contests, sila.ai work..) are either contests in process, or confidential with other people, hence cannot be shared. This is still a work in progress, and will be continuously updated.

I prefer this to a linked-in, for privacy purposes. I hope you enjoy your stay!

Best
