Brief teaser for recruiters

Hi there! I see you've found your way to my online portfolion. This likely means I've submit my CV to your company. Thanks for making it here! 
The folders in this github correspond to listed projects on the cv.

Start with Image_Partitioning, it is older, but more meaningful for me (will tell you more about me). Note I am not making the code public now, but I'll show it if requested.

Then, if you wish, more to lira_prediction, it is a more recent group project, and many codes are included.

My other projects (RPS contests, sila.ai work..) are either contests in process, or held under an NDA, so I must refrain from sharing here.

I prefer this to a linked-in, for privacy purposes. I hope you enjoy your stay!

Best
